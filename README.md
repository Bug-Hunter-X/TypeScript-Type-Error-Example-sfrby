# TypeScript Type Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript. The `add` function expects two numbers as input, but the provided code attempts to pass a string.  TypeScript's type system will catch this error during compilation, preventing runtime issues.

## Bug
The `bug.ts` file contains the code that causes the type error.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a possible solution by performing type checking and conversion before the addition operation.
